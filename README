Update 1 June 2009
* defn now expands in terms of the fn macro
* lots more error checking.  Some simple checks for misformed binders, also checks for arity when the function is called.

Update 31 May 2009
* added support for multiple arity defn and fn definitions:

    (defn f 
      ([x] x)
	  ([x y] (* x y)))
    (f 10) ; -> 10
    (f 10 20) ; -> 200

  

Some emacs utilities with clojure-style destructuring bind.

	 (defn demo [a b [c d]] (list a b c d))
	 (demo 1 2 (list 10 11)) -> (1 2 10 11)

The binding also works with hashtables.

	(defn demo [a b [:: c :x d :y]] (list a b c d))
	(let ((a-table (tbl! :x 100 :y 110)))
	  (demo 1 2 a-table)) -> (1 2 100 110)

Most useful in the utils package may be a pair of functions for creating and manipulating hash tables.

	 (tbl! :x 10 :y 11) ; creates a hash table with keys :x, :y and associated values
	 (tbl a-table :x) ; returns the value at key :x
